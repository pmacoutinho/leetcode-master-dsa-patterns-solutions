# Algomaster - Master DSA Patterns Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **Algomaster Master DSA Patterns** problems on LeetCode. The goal of this repository is to systematically practice and master common **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) patterns**.

## About
The **Algomaster - Master DSA Patterns** track is a curated set of problems on LeetCode designed to teach problem-solving using **repeating DSA patterns**. This repository contains my solutions for the exercices.

## DSA Patterns Covered
Some of the patterns that will be included in this repository are:
(remember, this is still a work in progress)

- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
- In-place Reversal of Linked List
- Top K Elements
- Subsets / Combinations / Permutations
- Modified Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming Patterns
- Graph Traversals (BFS / DFS)
- Backtracking
